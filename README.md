# Traffic Light System Verilog with Xilinx --  

First create a xilinx project and use following steps to add these source files

To Add a Source File to a Project

     Select Project > Add Source, or click the Add File toolbar button Image.
     In the Add Source dialog box, browse to the source file and select it.
     Click Open.
     In the Adding Source Files dialog box, do the following:
         In the Association field, select the Design View in which you want the source file to appear. For more information on Design Views, see Using the Design Views. You can change the Design View association after the source file has been added, as described in Changing Source Properties.
        Note For simulation source files, including test benches, you must ensure that the associated Design View is set to a Simulation view. Project Navigator automatically selects the Design View association for simulation source files and test benches based on the source file name. For more information, including how to customize this automatic selection, see Test Benches.
         In the Library column, select a library from the drop-down list, or select New VHDL Library to create a VHDL library.
     Click OK.
